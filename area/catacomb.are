North entrance to the catacombs~
You are almost surprised to see a tunnel leading off to the south
into utter darkness.  The floorboards above you haven't been moved
in a long time, yet there is life down here.  A beam of light from
the opening above you falls upon a message scrawled on the wall here.

The message reads:
     Adventure for the strong yet calculating
     Death for the weak and shallow
     Treasure for the smart and lucky
     Death for the stupid and accursed

An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering up
from the catacombs.

The holy place~
A glowing stone lies in the center of the clearing.  You recognize it as
the stone of the Excalibur.  The strange humming glowing makes it
difficult to see if the Excalibur is there or not. Might want to take a
closer look if possible.

Misty passageway~
Warm mist swirl about you making you feel threatened as well as
protected at the same time.  The swirling mist makes it tough to tell
directions quite clearly, but you seem to be able to go north or south.
The mist gets denser to the south.

Intersection of caverns~
Caverns head north, south and east from this peculiar spot. Medium
sized caverns from the east and the north join to form a huge cavern
heading south.  The walls of the cavern are made of a bizarre mixture
of many shiny crystals.

Entrance to the burial grounds~
You have entered what appears to be a burial ground of sorts. The
templars buried their dead here.  Chills go down your spine as you feel
something watching you.  You hear the random groan of a ghost, the howl
of a wraith, and the dry clanking of bones.

The burial grounds~
Random tombs to unknown warriors were lain in rows as far as the eye
can see.  To your horror many of the graves are empty and desecrated.
A gap in the rows of tombs leads south and there are more graves to the
east and west.

the biggest in the catacombs.  Crystals of every color cast prismatic
sprays of light everywhere.  The light from your lamp causes almost a
blinding flare of brilliance as more light is added to the multi-colored
twinkling phenomenon that exists here.  This is also the lair of the
fabled and feared Prism Dragon.
